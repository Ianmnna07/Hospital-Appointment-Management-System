Project Overview
This project is a Hospital Appointment Management System developed using Python.
The system is designed to manage patients, doctors, and appointment scheduling in a hospital environment.
It helps reduce manual scheduling errors and prevents double booking of doctors.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Requirement Analysis
The system is required to:
	•	Register patients
	•	Register doctors
	•	Book appointments between patients and doctors
	•	Prevent doctors from being booked twice on the same date
	•	Display all scheduled appointments

⸻

System Design
The system follows an object-oriented design approach.

Classes used in the system include:
	•	Patient
	•	Doctor
	•	Appointment
	•	HospitalManagementSystem

Each class represents a real-world hospital entity.
The system uses a menu-driven command line interface for user interaction.

⸻

Implementation
The system was implemented using the Python programming language.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles were applied to ensure modularity and clarity.

Main program file:
hospital_management_system.py

⸻

Testing
Manual testing was carried out by:
	•	Adding patients and doctors
	•	Booking appointments
	•	Ensuring doctors cannot be double-booked
	•	Validating incorrect patient or doctor IDs

⸻

Deployment
The application can be deployed on any computer system with Python 3 installed.
No external libraries are required to run the program.

⸻

Maintenance and Future Enhancements
The system can be improved by:
	•	Integrating a database for data persistence
	•	Adding appointment cancellation features
	•	Including patient medical records
	•	Developing a graphical or web-based interface
